# alphasnip

A really quick and crappy utility I made to make it easier to make alpha masks.

To use, this expects an image with a black background and one with a white background, sequentially named. ("image01.png", "image02.png"). It doesn't matter which color comes first. You can drag an entire group of images onto AlphaSnip, but it expects an even number of them and for them to be named properly, as it pairs each two images as it comes across them!

You can drag images onto it, or if that doesn't work, place it in the folder with the images.
