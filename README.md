A really quick and crappy utility I made to make it easier to make alpha masks.

To use, this expects an image or series of images, with a black background and one with a white background, sequentially named. (IE: "image01.png, image02.png, image03.png, image04.png" or "snap_a.png, snap_b.png, snap_c.png, snap_d.png"). No specific names are required. It doesn't matter which color comes first, only that the images come in pairs one after the other.

You can drag images onto it, or if that doesn't work, place it in the folder with the images.

v1.3 adjusts levels to give pure white and black, so pictures taken with foggy windlights should still work, but might not be perfect.

Every once in a while it will mismatch images or decide they're the wrong color, these will probably have to be done by hand instead!
